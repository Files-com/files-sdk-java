* `health_check_type` / `healthCheckType`  (string): Type of health check to perform.
* `interval` / `interval`  (int64): Interval in seconds between health checks.
* `min_free_cpu` / `minFreeCpu`  (double): Minimum free CPU percentage required for this backend to be considered healthy.

## List Remote Mount Backends

```
ListIterator<RemoteMountBackend> remoteMountBackend = RemoteMountBackend.list(
    
    HashMap<String, Object> parameters = null,
    HashMap<String, Object> options = null
)
```

### Parameters

* `cursor` (String): Used for pagination.  When a list request has more records available, cursors are provided in the response headers `X-Files-Cursor-Next` and `X-Files-Cursor-Prev`.  Send one of those cursor value here to resume an existing list from the next available record.  Note: many of our SDKs have iterator methods that will automatically handle cursor-based pagination.
* `per_page` (Long): Number of records to show per page.  (Max: 10,000, 1,000 or less is recommended).
