## List Requests

```
List<Request> request = Request.list(
    
    HashMap<String, Object> parameters = null,
    HashMap<String, Object> options = null
)
```

### Parameters

* `cursor` (String): Used for pagination.  When a list request has more records available, cursors are provided in the response headers `X-Files-Cursor-Next` and `X-Files-Cursor-Prev`.  Send one of those cursor value here to resume an existing list from the next available record.  Note: many of our SDKs have iterator methods that will automatically handle cursor-based pagination.
* `per_page` (Long): Number of records to show per page.  (Max: 10,000, 1,000 or less is recommended).
* `sort_by` (Map<String, String>): If set, sort records by the specified field in either `asc` or `desc` direction (e.g. `sort_by[destination]=desc`). Valid fields are `destination`.
* `mine` (Boolean): Only show requests of the current user?  (Defaults to true if current user is not a site admin.)
* `path` (String): Path to show requests for.  If omitted, shows all paths. Send `/` to represent the root directory.
