## List Inbound S3 Logs

```
ListIterator<InboundS3Log> inboundS3Log = InboundS3Log.list(
    
    HashMap<String, Object> parameters = null,
    HashMap<String, Object> options = null
)
```

### Parameters

* `cursor` (String): Used for pagination.  When a list request has more records available, cursors are provided in the response headers `X-Files-Cursor-Next` and `X-Files-Cursor-Prev`.  Send one of those cursor value here to resume an existing list from the next available record.  Note: many of our SDKs have iterator methods that will automatically handle cursor-based pagination.
* `per_page` (Long): Number of records to show per page.  (Max: 10,000, 1,000 or less is recommended).
* `filter` (Map<String, String>): If set, return records where the specified field is equal to the supplied value. Valid fields are `operation`, `status`, `path`, `client_ip` or `created_at`. Valid field combinations are `[ operation ]`, `[ status ]`, `[ path ]`, `[ client_ip ]`, `[ created_at ]`, `[ operation, status ]`, `[ operation, path ]`, `[ operation, client_ip ]`, `[ operation, created_at ]`, `[ status, path ]`, `[ status, client_ip ]`, `[ status, created_at ]`, `[ path, client_ip ]`, `[ path, created_at ]`, `[ client_ip, created_at ]`, `[ operation, status, path ]`, `[ operation, status, client_ip ]`, `[ operation, status, created_at ]`, `[ operation, path, client_ip ]`, `[ operation, path, created_at ]`, `[ operation, client_ip, created_at ]`, `[ status, path, client_ip ]`, `[ status, path, created_at ]`, `[ status, client_ip, created_at ]`, `[ path, client_ip, created_at ]`, `[ operation, status, path, client_ip ]`, `[ operation, status, path, created_at ]`, `[ operation, status, client_ip, created_at ]`, `[ operation, path, client_ip, created_at ]` or `[ status, path, client_ip, created_at ]`.
