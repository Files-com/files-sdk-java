# Files.Models.IpAddress

## Example IpAddress Object

{
  "id": "Site",
  "associated_with": "Site",
  "group_id": 1,
  "ip_addresses": [
    "127.0.0.1"
  ]
}
```

* `id` / `id`  (string): Unique label for list; used by Zapier and other integrations.
* `associated_with` / `associatedWith`  (string): The object that this public IP address list is associated with.

## List IP Addresses associated with the current site

```
ListIterator<IpAddress> ipAddress = IpAddress.list(
    
    HashMap<String, Object> parameters = null,
    HashMap<String, Object> options = null
)
```

### Parameters

* `cursor` (String): Used for pagination.  When a list request has more records available, cursors are provided in the response headers `X-Files-Cursor-Next` and `X-Files-Cursor-Prev`.  Send one of those cursor value here to resume an existing list from the next available record.  Note: many of our SDKs have iterator methods that will automatically handle cursor-based pagination.
* `per_page` (Long): Number of records to show per page.  (Max: 10,000, 1,000 or less is recommended).
* `action` (String): 
* `page` (Long):
